NOTE 1: Some cool tips, if you type /nick NEWNAME you can change your nickname, if you type /exit, /quit, or /q your exited from the server/room, and if you type /r or /room the server will send you back a list of all connected clients with their nicknames.
NOTE 2: If you want to run this where ever you go, you can put this script and a portable version of Python on a flash drive. A well known portable version is at portablepython.com.
